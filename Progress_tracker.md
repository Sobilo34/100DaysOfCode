# 100 Days Of Code -  Progress Tracker

## Day_01: Wed March 13, 2024 

**Language**: JavaScript

**Topic**:  Object, Scopes and Closures In JavaScript

**Notes:**

- A coding practice was done on my just completed Alx-Project on Objects, scopes and closures in JavaScript.
- Objects are special types of functions that makes coding easier with a defined way of coding.  
- It does what a function do in Procedural Oriented Programming
- Scopes in JS is what determines the accessibility and visibility of different variables, objects, and functions
- Closures are functions that encapsulate variables from their parent functions
- Many Live examples have been solved to explain the concept. View the codes in the link below:

**Challenges:**

-  The program receives String for a User and prints out the ASCII value of it lowercase

I have network Isuue which makes me to submit lately. The network Issue is common to all Nigerians today 🤦‍♂️
